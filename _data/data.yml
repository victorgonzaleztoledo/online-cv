    title: PHP Developer
    summary: |
      I've been a professional developer for more than 10 years and 
      I've been programming daily for about 20 years, and as Socrates 
      said: 'I know that I know nothing'. 
      
      I have an insane drive to 
      every single day become a better programmer, co-worker, friend, 
      husband, father, person, etc. 
      
      We are what we repeatedly do, so, excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.

      time: October, 2015 - Present day
      company: Cotronic, S.A. (Grupo Cobra), Málaga
      details: |
        During this period, as I became the only member of the software
        development department, besides being responsible for both the
        front-end and back-end, I was also in charge of the functional
        development of the applications, that is, gathering requirements,
        analyzing use cases, and writing unit tests. Starting to use PHP 7
        for the backend of the new applications, making use of JSON format
        for communications, using jQuery for the front-end and HTML5 with
        bootstrap3 for the creation of responsive designs. During this period,
        in addition to maintaining the aforementioned applications,
        applications have been developed for fleet control, invoicing control,
        payments to external suppliers, and time control of contracted personnel.
        For the set of applications it has also been necessary to create batch
        processes, reading and handling of email inboxes, calls to curl_exec
        simulating web browsers for both the collection of information
        and sending forms.

      time: December, 2009 - September, 2015
      company: Cotronic, S.A. (Grupo Cobra), Málaga
      details: |
          Acting primarily as the team's back-end developer, I was in charge
          of the design and maintenance of the database, using MySQL Workbench,
          and also of the creation and optimization of MySQL queries. Building
          a solid PHP back-end, exposing the data to the front-end via RESTFul
          API mainly via XML format. On the front-end part, we had javascript
          making use of an open-source library for user interface design and
          using Xajax to make POST calls to the back-end. During these years
          we developed applications for the management of human resources,
          control of the supply of tools and devices, control of warehouses,
          and management of external suppliers. These applications required 
          document management and also the creation and reading of XLS 
          and PDF files.

    - role: Flex-3 Developer
      time: March, 2009 - October, 2009
      company: Accenture S.A.
      details: |
          Working as a programmer with the Flex 3 framework (Adobe) for a project
          for the client Applus+. In this Project, we used Scrum as a development
          methodology. Tasks to be performed could be specified either in a 
          technical document or in a functional one. These tasks came with 
          their estimated development time. Subversion was used for version control.
          As none of the team members knew the environment, we received a training
          that lasted a couple of weeks and we started working with the client.
          Being one of the developers who learned the technology and the framework
          the fastest, I designed, together with my analyst, the templates and classes
          that we ended up using for the project. In addition to carrying out my tasks,
          in the daily scrum I was in charge of helping colleagues who had problems 
          with their developments.

    - role: SAP Developer
      time: June, 2008 - March, 2009
      company: Accenture S.A.
      details: |
          Working as a SAP R/3 developer for a Givaudan project with part of the team in 
          Malaga, Barcelona and Geneva (Switzerland). In this Project, we also used the 
          Scrum methodology. As soon as I got to know how the project worked, I started 
          to work directly in the client's forum-chat giving and receiving feedback 
          directly with the client's functional analysts. During the last sprints of 
          the project the project management decided to send me to Geneva to develop 
          tasks with the highest priority. The client was happy with my role and 
          I was one of the last programmers to leave the project.
          - Experience working in an English speaking environment
    - role: SAP Developer
      time: October, 2007 - May, 2008
      company: Accenture S.A.
      details: |
          Working as SAP R/3 developer for a Johnson & Johnson project with about ten
          co-workers. Tasks to be performed could be specified either in a technical 
          document or in a functional one. These tasks came with their estimated
          development time. Subversion was used for version control. After the first
          few months, I could  work directly with the functional analyses of the customer.  
          Also, in the daily scrum, I was in charge of supporting the other developers
          who had problems with their corresponding developments. This project was one
          of the projects taken as a sample for the development center to obtain the 
          CMMI 5 software quality qualification.
